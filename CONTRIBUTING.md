## Getting started

### Prerequisites

1. Install and setup [kpack](https://github.com/pivotal/kpack/blob/main/docs/install.md)
1. Install [kpack cli](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/kpack-cli/releases)
1. Create dev namespace
   ```bash
   kubectl create namespace dev
   ```
1. Create a secret with push credentials for the docker registry that you plan on publishing OCI images to with kpack
    ```bash
   kubectl create secret docker-registry kpack-registry-credentials \                                                130 â†µ emjohnson@emjohnson-a03
    --docker-username=_json_key \
    --docker-password="$(cat key.json)" \
    --docker-server=gcr.io \
    --namespace dev
    ```
1. Create a ClusterBuilder (and ServiceAccount, ClusterStore, ClusterStack)
    ```bash
   ytt -v tag=<my-clusterbuilder-tag> -f hack/kpack.yaml | kubectl apply -f -
   ```

   For example:
   ```bash
   ytt -v tag=gcr.io/kontinue/emj/clusterbuilder -f hack/kpack.yaml | kubectl apply -f -
   ```
1. Get appropriate permissions to run
    ```bash
   kubectl apply -f config/rbac.yaml
   eval "$(./config/get_auth.sh)"

### Run as action

[//]: # (TODO: See POC)

## Contribution Flow

This is a rough outline of what a contributor's workflow looks like:

* Make a fork of the repository within your GitHub account
* Create a topic branch in your fork from where you want to base your work
* Make commits of logical units
* Make sure your commit messages are with the proper format, quality and descriptiveness (see below)
* Push your changes to the topic branch in your fork
* Create a pull request containing that commit

We follow the GitHub workflow and you can find more details on
the [GitHub flow documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow).

### Pull Request Checklist

Before submitting your pull request, we advise you to use the following:

1. Check if your code changes will pass both code linting checks and unit tests.
2. Ensure your commit messages are descriptive. We follow the conventions
   on [How to Write a Git Commit Message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/). Be sure to include any related
   GitHub issue references in the commit message.
   See [GFM syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#GitHub-flavored-markdown)
   for referencing issues and commits.
3. Check the commits and commits messages and ensure they are free from typos.

## Reporting Bugs and Creating Issues

For specifics on what to include in your report, please follow the guidelines in the issue and pull request templates
when available.

## Ask for Help

The best way to reach us with a question when contributing is to ask on:

* The original GitHub issue
